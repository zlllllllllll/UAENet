Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is a critical procedure that could be used to treat various gynecological conditions. The key to the success of UAE technology lies in accurately identifying the uterine artery (UA) and its origin on the internal iliac artery angiography (IIA), which primarily depends on the subjective judgment of interventional radiologists. We developed a deep learning model called UAENet to automatically detect the UA and localize its origin during UAE.
